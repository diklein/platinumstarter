// Should the clicked clip keep PLAYING while it flies into the modal?
//
// TRUE (the shipped behaviour): the flying clone is a second live <video> that resumes from the
// origin's exact frame, so the clip never stops moving as it travels into the modal.
//
// FALSE: the clone is the FROZEN frame instead (flightPoster, a canvas snapshot of the clicked
// frame). Identical pixels, no video element inside the animating layer; the clip just does not
// advance during the flight. The handoff is frame-accurate either way, because the modal clip
// starts from photo.videoTime — the same frame the clone starts from — and both play at 1x, so
// they stay together without anything having to reconcile them (see LightboxVideo).
//
// Kept as a switch because it was the prime suspect for a Safari-only white flash on click. It is
// NOT the cause: the flash survived flipping this off. (The real ones: the clone painting frame 0
// before its seek landed, and the page fade starting before the clone was on screen.)

          (theme ink, surface hover), all floating over the photo. Dark material (black-tinted blur, boosted saturation)
          is the HIG direction for light text over photos — readable on any image, no
          scrim. The caption is always present (the 5s auto-hide was removed — it kept
          fighting the glass and the reader alike). The dock fades with the swipe-down drag via dragOpacity;
          while that ancestor opacity dips below 1 the card's blur goes flat (backdrop
          root) — accepted, it's a dismissal gesture over a moving photo.

          Entrance DURING the fly-in: arrows and caption card rise in lockstep from
          below the viewport edge alongside the photo's flight. It is a pure CSS
          keyframes animation (.lightbox-dock-enter, globals) applied to the dock's
          CHILDREN, never this dock: motion re-applies its cached transform/will-change
          to this element on every re-render (capOnPhoto and dockEntered flip at
          runtime), and any transform on an ANCESTOR of the glass card makes it the
          backdrop root — the card's blur samples a transparent subtree instead of the
          photo (flat tint; shift-click slow-mo turned that into 3.6s of missing blur).
          The card's OWN transform keeps its backdrop sampling live, so the glass blurs
          for the whole ride up. dockRiseClass comes off once the entrance ends —
          per-photo remounts of the keyed card must not replay it. motion owns ONLY the
          dragOpacity binding here (opacity 1 at rest — no backdrop root; it dips
